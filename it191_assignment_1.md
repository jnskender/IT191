I have been a part of a multitude of coding and tech based projects with my peers which has given me insight into working with a team in the industry. I have completed projects specifically in the .net framework that have been of real word applications that have taught me the lifecycle of a web application. As a student who has served fine dining during college to pay for my tuition, I have learned invaluable time management and communications skills that I believe set me apart from other CS/IT majors. In the remaining time I have at University, I will strive to further improve my qualifications for future jobs by participating in online courses in supporting web languages and frameworks. I have plans to take courses in jQuery, angular, and SQL. I hope to apply theses new skills to projects outside of University in which I can showcase in a portfolio. I have picked these specific areas as they seem to be reoccurring in multiple job listings as good experience to have. I will also continue to work on networking and communication skills that will be vital to my future success.  
   As far as job listings 5-8 years down the road, it is a much harder question to answer. In general terms I can assume that the projects I work on throughout the beginning of my career will give me a lot of the necessary skills and exposure to what I will need to eventually become a senior developer. Outside of these projects I fully intend to learn new and useful frameworks as technology advances to keep my skills fresh and relevant. Attending seminars in my field will also give me a great chance to better my chances for advancement in the industry.  I will hope to have plenty of professional references from my peers in the industry to help secure any senior level jobs. I believe knowing the right people is just, if not more, important that skill level. Networking will hopefully provide me the opportunities to land me what I would consider my dream job in this field.
